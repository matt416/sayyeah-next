<v Mark>You know, one of the things that I've loved doing</v>

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.050 line:55%
when working with you has been

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.350
basically getting into you and the rest of the team's mind,

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.340
as someone brings out a very complex solution

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.795
and you're able to lead them through your process

6
00:00:14.795 --> 00:00:19.490
that boils down, okay you've got your 57 steps here.

7
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.380
Here's how it could be done in four.

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.850
I think that to sync up your mind with the rest of the team

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.750
is being able to understand that and lead folks

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.370
through an engaging sort of systemic change,

11
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.350
as you said, bringing the process and the people

12
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.720
through that transformation,

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.304
and ultimately deliver a much more seamless, better product,

14
00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:47.304
so that it's all cohesive, and not just a product

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.163
to throw in any old culture.
