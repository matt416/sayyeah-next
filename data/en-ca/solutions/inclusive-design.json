    "text":"Traditionally, products and services have been designed for a more generalized market, or an average person. It was thought that, by designing to general standards, you could serve about 80% of people in a market but this approach has a number of risks associated with it because there is no average person.\n\n **There is no average person, so we must design for the needs of the individuals who make up the diverse markets we serve.**\n\n The users of your products and services are individuals with ever changing needs, behaviour, and contexts of engagement. The most effective products and services are designed through a process of understanding how personal and intersectional attributes shape markets."

Part of this process is being intentional about engaging with the variety of community members who make up your market. Our existing relationships and community outreach efforts consider members of LGBTQ+, indigenous, and groups of people with different physical and cognitive abilities, alongside our practices of ensuring representation by gender, race, cultural, religious, and economic factors."

This way, your product or service can excel at delighting all your potential users by ensuring these perspectives and needs are baked into the service model and user experience.\n\n Better still, the inclusive design process reduces the total design, development, production, and support costs and risks when compared to a traditional product development process."

By continuing this process of speaking to and testing with diverse users, we can continue to validate choices that impact the full spectrum of the market.\n\n The series of user testing methodologies at our disposal allows us to effectively uncover the most practical insights at each stage of the development cycle. Whether we are facilitating workshops, conducting interviews, running a usability test, surveying, or analyzing data, our ability to sort and synthesize findings, alongside our decades of technology and human-centered design experience, de-risks and accelerates any product or service design effort. With an inclusive lens added to this mix, you’ll have access to the most extensive validation processes available for vetting your products and services."
